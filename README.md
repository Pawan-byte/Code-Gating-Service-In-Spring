# CaseStudy-II Phase I

## INTRODUCTION
The project is aimed at building a Gating web service to help Developers write clean code. Given a source code repository, the web service 
calculates Cyclomatic complexities, Code Coverage, Duplication, Number of warnings and Security Flaws using respective tools.
The project integrates required tools and acts as a single point for the user's input. The Service generates a detailed report of the 
checks performed against the source code and intimates the user if the code is good enough.

## USAGE



# Directory Structure
- StaticCodeAnalysisSummarizer - main java project
- reports - The reports generated by different tools are stored here
- static-code-analyzers - the binaries of different code analyzers are stored here

# Usage
- To use the summarizer the project to be analyzed should be specified 
- Different options for output format and running the commands can be also be specified in map 

# Addition of new static code analyzers
- The binaries for the code analyzers are stored in static-code-analyzers and the path to those should be added while using them
- New tools can be easily added to the project by extending from StaticCodeAnalyzer abstract clas
