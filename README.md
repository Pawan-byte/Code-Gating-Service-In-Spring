# CaseStudy-II Phase I

## INTRODUCTION
The project is aimed at building a Gating web service to help Developers write clean code. Given a source code repository, the web service 
calculates Cyclomatic complexities, Code Coverage, Duplication, Number of warnings and Security Flaws using respective tools. The Service generates a detailed report of the checks performed against the source code and intimates the user if the code is good enough.

## USAGE

This project is helpful for developers in writing clean code by checking the Gating parameters for codes in a covenient way. Tools/Services exist for checking the Gating parameter individually. The project builds a web service that acts as a single point for user input and checks for all Gating parameters collectively by integrating all required tools 



# Directory Structure
- StaticCodeAnalysisSummarizer - main java project
- reports - The reports generated by different tools are stored here
- static-code-analyzers - the binaries of different code analyzers are stored here

# Usage
- To use the summarizer the project to be analyzed should be specified 
- Different options for output format and running the commands can be also be specified in map 

# Addition of new static code analyzers
- The binaries for the code analyzers are stored in static-code-analyzers and the path to those should be added while using them
- New tools can be easily added to the project by extending from StaticCodeAnalyzer abstract clas
